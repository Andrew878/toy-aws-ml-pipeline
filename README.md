# toy-aws-ml-pipeline
A toy example to:
* deploy an model training and inference pipeline on AWS Sagemaker
* deploy a combined container on AWS App Runner that serves a dash frontend and connects to a Postgres db
* deploy a (dummy) model endpoint alongside a dash front (each as separate microservices) both locally and using AWS ECS

Purely performed as a scrappy learning excercise
